                    The gateway is also the monument from where the last British troops left India in 1948, following Indian independence. It is located on the waterfront at an angle, opposite the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower Hotel and overlooks the Arabian Sea.

                    Marine Drive is situated on reclaimed land facing west-south-west. Marine Drive is also known as the Queen's Necklace because, when viewed at night from an elevated point anywhere along the drive, the street lights resemble a string of pearls in a necklace.

                    It is a cable bridge that connects Bandra in the west of Mumbai to Worli which is in the southern part of the city. The bridge has concrete steel viaducts on either of its sides which strengths its base. This bridge in Mumbai is a perfect example of the brilliant engineering works done by the authorities.

                    Mumbai locals are rightly called the lifeline of the city, with almost all of the city's inhabitants relying on them to get to work or other destinations at some point of time. Many of them rely on these services on a daily basis. This is why Mumbai Suburban Railways operates over 2,300 train services every single day.
